About me
======
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Yanwei Fu](https://yanweifu.github.io/).
My research interests focus on computer vision, which includes image inpainting, image synthesis, multi-view stereo, neural surface reconstruction, and feature matching.

Education
======
* Ph.D of Statistics (Machine Learning track), Fudan University, 2020 - Present.
* Master of Computer Science and Technology, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST), 2016 - 2019.
* Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST), 2012 - 2016.
